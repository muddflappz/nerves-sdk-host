nerves-sdk-host
===============

Dockerfile for hosting nerves-sdk (Ubuntu 12.04 based)

This Dockerfile is intended to help set up a development environment for 
embedded Erland development using the [nerves-project/nerves-sdk](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-sdk)

Although the environment created by this Dockerfile is based on Ubuntu 12.04,
it hosts on Ubuntu 14.04 quite well and alleviates the differences between
environments related to setting up i386 libraries.
